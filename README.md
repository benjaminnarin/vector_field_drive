# Velocity Field Movement Package
Has a couple hand-coded values in the `src/field_movement.py` file, notably the laser scan and command velocity topics.
These are currently set to work with the simulated turtlebot demo from Stage (the basic ROS demo one).

This package contains a launch file which brings up all three components, and with an xbox 360 gamepad you can examine the behavior of the robot.
(Remember that move enable is right stick in...)

The file `src/field_movement.py` can be directly executed, which should then show the debug print statements.
